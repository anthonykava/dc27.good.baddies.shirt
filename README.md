# dc27.good.baddies.shirt
Design for T-shirt I wore for a Skytalks 2019 talk inspired by Agent Ray in Hackers (Get yourself connected!)

dc27.shirt.work13.flat.finalq.trans.(xcf|png) - Standard style T-shirt graphic<br />
dc27.shirt.work14.flat.trans.wider7.(xcf|png) - Women's cut T-shirt graphic<br />

T-shirts were ordered from Zazzle.com.  Wider version worked better on the women's cut design because the printable area was wider than the other T-shirt form factors.

Not my best PS/GIMP work, but it's meant to look like cut-out newspaper anyway so that, combined with the medium, hides most sins.
